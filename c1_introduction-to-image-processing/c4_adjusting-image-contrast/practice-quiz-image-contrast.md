## Practice Quiz: Image Contrast and Histogram Concept Check

### Question 1

Which of the following best describes image contrast?

- The ratio of vertical columns of pixels to horizontal rows.
- **The visual distinction between the light and dark areas of an image.**
- The difference between the lightest and darkest pixel value in an image.
- The ratio of the number of pixels with the brightest value to the number of pixels with the darkest value.

### Question 2

Which of the following histrograms bet matches this image?

![1](./images/1.jpg)

- ![2](./images/2.jpg)
- ![3](./images/3.jpg)
- ![4](./images/4.jpg) - ANSWER
- ![5](./images/5.jpg)

> Notice how the bright white of the tower and the clouds contain many pixels in the brightest part of the histogram.

### Question 3

Thresholding segments a grayscale image according to brightness values. The details of how imbinarize chooses a threshold are beyond the scope of this course, but looking at an image histogram, it is sometimes possible to guess a good threshold value. Which of the following threshold values do you think would produce the best segmentation for this image?

- **Threshold = 98/255 = 0.3842 $\\$ ![6](./images/2.jpg)**
- Threshold = 127/255 = 0.5000 $\\$ ![7](./images/3.jpg)
- Threshold = 32/255 = 0.1255 $\\$ ![8](./images/4.jpg)
- Threshold = 165/255 = 0.6471 $\\$ ![9](./images/5.jpg)

> That thresholds procues best segmentation. It does a very good job in the lower, lighter region.
